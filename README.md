## Installation
In order to use the copy/paste features on linux computers you need to install 'xclip', 'xsel' or 'wl-clipboard' with apt.

The easiest way to "install" AESify is to download one of the release packages, unzip and simply run the binary.

Alternatively you can download the code folder and run the AESify.py script. In this case you have to install the packages PySimpleGUI, pyperclip and pikepdf using pip3.
